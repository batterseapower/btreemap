# btreemap

This is a simple and high-performance Java B-tree that is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement for java.util.TreeMap
in situations where the vanilla binary trees used by the JDK are just too slow.

The source code lives at [GitHub](http://batterseapower.github.io/btreemap/). If you just want some JARs, check out [Maven Central](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/uk.co.omega-prime/btreemap/).
